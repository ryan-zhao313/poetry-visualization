## Incorporating Feedback
I decided to change my visualization and add a second set of data I can use instead of just "Median Household Income".
Currently, the visualization is going to be a grouped bar chart with the left y-axis being the "median household income" and the right y-axis being the "percentage of adults with a bachelors".

Interactions: 
- Users can choose to show one bar chart with either median household income, percentage of adults with a bachelors, or both
- will be able to sort the graphs based on either one (after buttons are added for these functionalities)
- Bars can be highlighted

Connection to Poem: 
- Show the differences in adults with a bachelors degree when talking about the different jobs they can have
- Highlight the median household income disparity when it comes to different asian enthnic groups
